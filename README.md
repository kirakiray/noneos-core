# NoneOS Core

NoneOS Core is a lightweight core engine designed specifically for running ofa.js applications. It allows one-click startup, development, and debugging of ofa.js projects without the need to install any additional software.

The engine originates from NoneOS3, undergoing deep streamlining and architectural restructuring to achieve complete decoupling between the system and applications.

Our vision: To create a universal, minimal, and cross-platform application runtime environment that enables various applications to achieve truly seamless, efficient, and stable operation across different operating systems.

## Core Features

- **Lightweight Design** - Streamlined code architecture, removing redundant functionality, keeping the core engine lean and efficient
- **High-Performance Operation** - Optimized underlying engine providing a stable and efficient runtime environment, ensuring smooth application performance
- **Complete Compatibility** - Full support for development and operation of ofa.js applications, seamlessly integrating with the existing ecosystem
- **High Extensibility** - Modular design with the capability to support multiple front-end frameworks, reserving space for future expansion
